## 🌟 Key Features & Advanced Capabilities

### 1. 📱 Unlimited Multi-Account Management (Bypass the 3-Account Limit)
- **Eliminate Account Restrictions**: Completely removes Telegram Desktop's 3-account ceiling. Add 5, 20, 50, or 100+ accounts concurrently without requiring Telegram Premium subscriptions.
- **Fluid Vertical Account Dock**: Sleek desktop dock displaying real-time unread badges, active account avatars, and zero-latency switching.
- **Rapid 3-Second QR Authentication**: Log in in seconds by scanning a QR code with the Telegram mobile app (*Settings > Devices > Link Desktop Device*) or using international phone numbers with full 2FA Cloud Password support.
- **Instant Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press `Ctrl + 1..9` to switch between active identities instantly.

### 2. 🔒 Dedicated & Isolated Proxy Per Account (Zero Cross-Account Ban Risk)
- **Per-Account Network Isolation**: Assign independent proxies (SOCKS5, HTTP, or MTProto) to individual accounts to completely isolate network traffic and eliminate IP ban chain-reactions.
- **Real-Time Ping Latency Monitor**: Live latency tester measures response time and packet health before establishing connection to prevent dropouts.
- **Independent Fallback Handling**: If one proxy encounters latency, other accounts remain unaffected on their dedicated tunnels.

### 3. 🛡️ Combinatorial Anti-Fingerprinting & Hardware Spoofing (Anti-Ban Shield)
- **Cryptographic Device Masking**: Prevents Telegram's security algorithms from fingerprinting and correlating multiple accounts to a single physical machine.
- **28+ Authentic Workstation Profiles**: Automatically generates realistic, cryptographically consistent hardware identities mimicking Dell XPS, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Microsoft Surface Pro, ASUS ZenBook, and Apple MacBook Pro workstations.
- **Randomized System Envelopes**: Randomizes Windows UBR build numbers, system architectures, and localized language configurations per session.

### 4. 💼 100% Truly Portable & Self-Contained Architecture
- **Zero Windows Registry Pollution**: Leaves zero traces in Windows registry and creates zero hidden config files in `%APPDATA%` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
- **Single Directory Footprint**: All session tokens, encryption keys, proxy rosters, and client preferences reside in a local `./data` folder adjacent to the executable.
- **Instant Flash Drive Portability**: Backup, duplicate, or transfer your entire multi-account workstation simply by copying the folder to another PC or USB thumb drive.

### 5. ⚡ Parallel Chunk Download Acceleration (Up to 3x Faster)
- **Multi-Worker MTProto Pipeline**: Unlike official Telegram clients that download media sequentially over a single stream, Guidegram automatically engages **4 parallel concurrent MTProto workers** with chunked 512KB buffers for files and videos larger than 2MB.
- **High-Velocity Media Streaming**: Drastically accelerates video buffering, audio caching, and large document transfers.

### 6. 📊 Deep Group Statistics & Member Activity Intelligence (Exclusive Superpower)
> **Missing in Official Telegram Desktop**: The official desktop client offers zero engagement analytics for group chats. Guidegram fills this major void by embedding a comprehensive, real-time analytics suite accessible right from any group's header (`BarChart3` icon):
- **Active Members Leaderboard**: Real-time ranking of the most active group contributors, detailing exact message counts, percentage contribution to total conversation traffic, and direct user profile cards.
- **Dynamic Timeframe Slicing with MTProto Auto-Sync**: Defaults to **Today** (امروز) and supports instant one-click switching to **Yesterday**, **Past 7 Days**, and **Past 30 Days**. If loaded memory doesn't yet cover the chosen window, Guidegram automatically queries and paginates MTProto server batches until the boundary timestamp is reached.
- **24-Hour Hourly Activity Heatmap**: Visual bar chart breakdown identifying peak conversation hours to optimize broadcast schedules, product drops, and community engagement.
- **Media & Message Composition Matrix**: Categorized traffic metrics covering Text, Photos, Videos, Voice Notes, Documents, and Stickers.
- **Word & Character Velocity**: Aggregate word count and average message density metrics.

### 7. 👁️ Ghost Mode & Anonymous Stealth Stories Viewer
- **Invisible Reading**: Read incoming direct messages and group chats without sending read receipts (suppresses double checkmarks).
- **Stealth Story Viewer**: View user stories directly from avatar story rings without triggering `stories.readStories` view logs.
- **Typing Status Masking**: Prevents transmitting "typing..." or "recording voice..." presence indicators to peers.

### 8. 📜 Infinite Chat History Scroll & Zero-Jitter Pagination
- **Bidirectional Continuous History**: Scrolling to the top of any chat triggers seamless 50-message chunk retrieval from Telegram's MTProto servers via `offsetId` pagination.
- **Scroll Jump Compensation**: Viewport scroll position is preserved smoothly using exact height delta compensation (`newScrollHeight - prevScrollHeight + prevScrollTop`), allowing users to scroll back seamlessly to the very first message ever sent in a conversation without visual jitter or jumping.

### 9. 🗂️ Deep Dialog Pagination (Full Private Chat Visibility)
- **350-Dialog Extended Depth**: Initial dialog fetch expanded to 350 conversations (up from 150), preventing high-traffic channels and supergroups from burying personal direct messages (PVs).
- **Infinite Sidebar Scrolling**: Scrolling near the bottom of the conversation list automatically fetches older dialog batches using `offsetDate` pagination, with instant deduplication and zero flicker.

### 10. 🚀 Direct Forward Without Quote (Telegraph Style)
- **Clean Message Forwarding**: Re-post messages with original author headers and channel forward credits cleanly stripped (`dropAuthor: true` in MTProto).
- **One-Click Hotkey**: Hover over any message and press `Alt + F` to open the direct forwarding modal instantly.

### 11. 🛡️ Guidegram Data Shield & Installer Safety Architecture
- **In-Place Upgrade Protection**: The NSIS installer (`build/installer.nsh`) permanently disables recursive directory wipes (`RMDir /r $INSTDIR`). Selecting an existing directory updates application binaries only, preserving the `data/` directory (sessions, accounts, settings, caches) completely intact.
- **Dual-Layer Mirrored Safe Backup**: Automatically mirrors all account sessions and configs to an OS-protected location (`%APPDATA%/Guidegram/safe_backup`). If local data is ever removed or damaged, Guidegram auto-restores all accounts and credentials on next launch.
- **Safe Directory Encapsulation**: Non-empty directories without Guidegram binaries are automatically protected by encapsulating installation inside a dedicated folder.

### 12. 🖥️ Complete Official Telegram Desktop Parity
- **Main Menu Drawer**: Complete parity with official Telegram Desktop, featuring high-resolution avatars, full formatted names, @username handles, and direct access navigation.
- **My Profile Drawer**: In-depth personal profile drawer displaying biography, Telegram Star Gifts count, Data Center (DC) identifier, and Telegram Stars wallet balance.
- **Enterprise Settings**: Deep unified configuration modal with media cache purge, custom downloads path, privacy and security toggles, and shortcuts guide.

### 13. ⚡ Advanced Desktop Power Features
- **Show Chat ID & Message ID**: Interactive badges in the header and message footer with 1-click clipboard copy.
- **Message Timestamp with Seconds**: Millisecond-accurate timestamp display (`HH:mm:ss`).
- **Quick Forward to Saved Messages**: Bookmark action on hover + instant `Ctrl + Click` shortcut on any message bubble.
- **Group Sender Avatars**: Distinct visual sender avatars displayed next to messages in supergroups.
- **Bot Inline Button Inspection**: Click or right-click any inline keyboard button to inspect and copy `callback_data`.
- **Mark All Chats As Read**: One-click bulk read button in folder tabs with channel read-pointer advancement.
- **Deep Link Navigation**: Native handling of `tg://user?id=...`, `tg://openmessage`, and `@username` deep links.

### 14. 🛡️ Tiered In-App Update Enforcement & Protocol Safety
- **Automated Update Notification**: Background checks and startup verifications against GitHub Releases.
- **Mandatory Protocol & Security Safeguards**: Major and minor version upgrades along with critical security patches enforce mandatory update banners to guarantee network stability and prevent desynchronization with Telegram MTProto layers.
- **Session Soft Dismissal**: Routine cosmetic patch updates allow temporary dismissal for the active session, resurfacing politely upon restart.

### 15. 🎭 Animated Stickers Drawer (TGS Lottie & WebP)
- **Built-in Sticker Picker**: Sticker drawer (`Smile` button in composer) displaying all installed sticker packs directly from your Telegram cloud profile.
- **Vector Animation Rendering**: Real-time client-side `.tgs` gzip decompression and interactive vector animation rendering via `lottie-web`.
- **Instant MTProto Sending**: Sends using native MTProto `Api.InputDocument` references without re-uploading file bytes.

### 16. 📌 Multi-Cycle Pinned Messages & Dedicated Search Drawer (TDesktop v6.7.8+)
